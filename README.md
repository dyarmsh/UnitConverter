# UnitConverter
This unit converter converts between metric and imperial units of length, volume and mass with a pleasing, user-friendly UI design provided by Scrimba (but styled on CSS and HTML by me).

This is my first complete front-end project! I used JavaScript for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am so fascinated by the power of this language and the way it transforms webpages.
